// Grounded citation verification (support-oriented).
//
// The RAG "support" metric asks: is each cited sentence actually supported by
// the document it cites? LLMs frequently cite a topically-related doc that does
// not actually state the sentence's claim. This module does a cheap, LLM-free
// check: for each (sentence, cited docid) pair, locate the best-matching passage
// in the doc and measure how much of the sentence's content vocabulary appears
// there. Citations whose support is too weak are dropped; sentences left with no
// citation are removed; references are rebuilt to only still-cited docids.
//
// This targets support precision without changing retrieval or coverage.
