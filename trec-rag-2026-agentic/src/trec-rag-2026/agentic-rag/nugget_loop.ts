// ⑤ Self-assign gap-fill loop.
//
// The RAG task is scored as recall over vital nuggets, so the generator is optimising a target it never
// sees. This module closes that loop at inference time: it predicts the nugget list for a narrative with
// the SAME prompts the organizers' AutoNuggetizer uses (ported from RAGDoll's
// `ragdoll/nuggetizer/prompts.py`), assigns the draft answer against them, and reports which vital
// nuggets the draft misses so the caller can run targeted retrieval for exactly those.
//
// Evidence this helps: TICK/STICK (arXiv 2410.03608) reports +7.8% absolute from self-refinement against
// a self-generated checklist. Nothing here touches gold nuggets — the predicted list is built from the
// narrative and our own retrieved evidence only.

 * Predict the nugget list for this narrative from our own retrieved evidence, one aspect at a time.

 * The creator prompt consolidates rather than accumulates -- it is told to keep "at most N nuggets (can

 * grow the list. One pass over 12 documents gave 24 nuggets; four batched passes gave 20. Both are far
 * short of the 41 vital nuggets per topic in the dev gold.
 *
 * The gold's own structure shows the way: its nuggets carry a `mapped_sub_narrative`, and a topic has a
 * median of 8 sub-narratives holding ~5 vital nuggets each. So ask per aspect and take the union -- the
 * consolidation pressure then applies within an aspect instead of across the whole narrative.
